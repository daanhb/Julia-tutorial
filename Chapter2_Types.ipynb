    "We have already encounted a few types, including the numeric types `Int64`, `Float64`. **Writing Julia revolves a lot around types**. You will be making lots of them, and using them all the time. You can be generous with new types, they are not scarce. Sometimes code you write creates types implicitly just to get things done - in that case the type is essentially a use-once-throw-away commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just make sure that, at the end of the day, you still have $O(1)$ types and not $O(N)$: remember that Julia makes specialized versions of functions for each combination of types that you use for arguments. Adding types increases the size of your code and adds to the compilation overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are *types*? All variables have a type. It is **compiler metadata** that describes what your variable stands for. Julia types compare a little bit to classes in an object-oriented language, but one should not stretch the comparison too much. Types do support inheritance. However, you are well advised to **resist that initial urge to create a fancy hierarchical tree of types like you would in OOP**: there is no need for that. The best reason to use types in Julia (and some would say the only reason) is to use *multiple dispatch*, and that is the topic of the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without multiple dispatch it is hard to convey the richness of the type system. Still, we have a quite a few things to discover already. As usual, the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/) is more complete than our set of examples."

    "You can not redefine existing types in the Julia workspace. This means that once you have defined `MyType`, you can not change its definition anymore. You can clear the current workspace with the command `workspace()`. While developing a larger program a good practice is to do all development inside a [module](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/modules/). You can reload a module and all definitions will be reloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing: for the time being, Julia does not keep track of code dependencies. If you change a function and pass it through the compiler again, Julia will not automatically recompile every other function which used the original verion of your function. It may have been inlined somewhere in its old version. This is different from Matlab, where if you change a function it will instantly be used everywhere. This behaviour could change in the future. If you write your code in a module, reloading the module is sufficient."

Essentially, you can only use it once. Having a function with two different meanings, depending on the types of the variables, is a good reason to type your arguments. In fact, this is an important lesson, so let's use bold to make sure you read this. **Using dispatch is the only reason for adding types to your arguments.** That's a bold statement indeed. It is not really true, though. Sometimes adding types make your code more readable. Sometimes it helps to catch bugs, if a variable is not of the type you were expecting it to be. On the other hand, a danger of *over-typing*, i.e. adding unnecessary type annotations, is that your code is less generic than it could be. You are limiting ways in which your function can be used.
